# Technolcolabs Machine Learning Internship

## Mini Project 1
#### Data Analysis on Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing Dataset
Under this project we had to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Dr. Semmelweis and
the Discovery of Handwashing Dataset and had to statistically 
prove the importance of washing hands before surgery to prevent child bed fever.

## Mini Project 2
#### Predicting Credit-Card Default
Under this project we were given a credit card dataset for 30000 customers,
which contained the past 6 months credit history of customers. 
Our task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Data, derive valuable insights from the data
and build a machine learning model that can predict 
whether the customer will default next month or not.
